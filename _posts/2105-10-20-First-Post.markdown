How I got started:
I have for years been stating that I was going to go back to school for tech but could never find the time with the hectic jobs I've alaways had. One day at the gym I ran into a friend who told me about a coding bootcamp that taught you how to become a software engineer in 90 days and with an average income of 105k. I would've been more skeptical if it wasn't for the spurce i was getting it from. I told my friend that it was something that i was looking for and i woould like more information. He was meeting with one of the founders in a coule of days. Once he had the meeting he gave me all the information and everything he said the first time seemed to still hold true. I asked to have a meeting set up as well so i could find out first hand. In the meantime I did some research on the subject, expecting to find some negative links on the subject. To my suprise after hours on the web, i couldn't find negative or fraud link statements.
